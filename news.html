		A man accused of tying up five people in a basement is taking a plea deal in Utah but still faces a murder case in Wyoming, where he's charged with kidnapping and killing a train worker while on the run from police.
Dereck James "DJ" Harrison pleaded guilty to five counts of aggravated kidnapping Monday. The rest of his 16 charges in Utah were dropped.
Prosecutors say the 23-year-old and his father lured a woman and her four teenage daughters to their house in May, tied them up and beat them before they managed to escape.
Police say the men used drugs heavily and thought the mother had reported them to authorities.
While fleeing that crime, the Harrisons are accused of snatching the rail worker and killing him as they drove to a Wyoming hideout.
Father Flint Harrison killed himself in jail in Июль.
